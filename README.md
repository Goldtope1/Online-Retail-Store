## INTRODUCTION

C-NET is an online retail store that sells household items to smaller retailers and end consumers. They have been in operation for 5 years. This data was provided to gain insight that would be valuable to the company as management want to analyse the major factors contributing to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year. With expansion in mind, the company is also seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep clear focus on whats is working  

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

- The Time series of the revenue by month
- The top 10 countris with the highest revenue including their quantities
- Top 10 customers by revenue
- An overview of the countries to see which region has the greatest demand for their product 

## SKILLS/CONCEPT DEMONSTRATED

Table Structuring, Data cleaning, powerQuery, Data Transformation, Data analysis & visualization 

## DATA TRANSFORMATION AND CLEANING

- The Data was structured in Excel and transformed in the power Query
- All quantity below 1 unit were filterwed out and all unit price below zero was filtered out as well
- A new measure was created to calculate the revenue i.e the product of the Quantity and unit price

## DATA VISUALIZATION & INSIGHTS

As the first question, the CEO  requested a trend of the revenue to see if there is any seasonality in the store sales. My analysis shows that there are some months of the year where exceptional growth is witnessed.

The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase in revenue starts in the month of September, where the revenue increases by 40% over the previous month. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.5 million USD, the highest during the entire year. The data is incomplete for the month of December, therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from it, unfortunately. This analysis shows that the retail store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the year. 

The second visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand and I’ve been told to focused on the countries where demand can be increased. The analysis shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated. I would suggest that these countries should be focused on to ensure that measures are taken to capture these markets even more.

The third analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 17% more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue. This shows that the bargaining power of customers is low and the business is in a good position.

Finally, the map chart shows the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with the regions that have not. It can be seen that apart from the UK, countries such as Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The map also shows that most of the sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these areas has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.
